# W-Particle Prediction Map (v3)

Vacant or near-vacant positions in the W-lattice correspond to **new particles**.

Known fermions occupy stable integer slots.  
Neighbour-slots and mid-slots define *future or hidden states*.

## Confirmed informational predictions

| Name | Region | Slot type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **t′** | above top | primary neighbour | Δm ~MeV, overlapped with t |
| **b′** | above bottom | primary neighbour | Δm extremely small |
| **L (τ′)** | above tau | primary neighbour | lepton doublet |
| **X** | c–b mid | geometric mid | ~2.2 GeV candidate |
| **Y1** | b–t mid | geometric mid | 10–30 GeV expected |

Primary = next integer slot (required by lattice).  
Mid = logarithmic midpoint (structured heavy-state).

## Why these predictions matter

- **X (~2.2 GeV)** → potentially observable in hadronic spectra  
- **Y1 (~10–30 GeV)** → testable region at collider energies  
- **t′, b′, L** → informational doublets hidden in parent resonance width  

This map is a minimum prediction set.  
Further states follow from the generation algorithm in `/docs`.

## Interpretation notes

- Informational mass is exact.
- Physical mass projection introduces experimental error.
- W-model predicts **existence before detection**.
