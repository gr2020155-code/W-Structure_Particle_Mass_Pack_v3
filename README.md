# W-Structure Pack v3 — Discrete Informational Mass Framework

This repository contains the core structure, tables and predictions of the **W-informational mass model**,  
where elementary particle masses are defined not by continuous fields, but by **discrete informational states**:

\[
m_{\text{inf}} = \frac{1}{N}, \qquad N = 2^s p q, \quad \gcd(p,q)=1
\]

There are no floating parameters.  
No fitting to experiment.  
Mass spectrum is *derived, not tuned*.

## Core idea in one line

> **Mass is informational.**  
> Continuous (GeV) masses = projection of discrete W-states.

\[
m_{phys} = m_{inf} \cdot m_e \cdot \frac{N_e}{N}
\]

The *only experimental input* is the electron.

## Main predictions (Pack v3)

| State | Region | Type | Expected behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **t′** | above top | required neighbour | doublet t–t′, Δm ~MeV |
| **b′** | above bottom | required neighbour | doublet b–b′, Δm tiny |
| **X** | between c and b | mid-quark | **≈2.2 GeV**, search candidate |
| **Y1** | between b and t | mid-quark | **10–30 GeV**, collider-accessible |
| **L (τ′)** | above τ | lepton neighbour | exists, merged with τ |
