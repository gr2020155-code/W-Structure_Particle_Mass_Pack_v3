# W-Particle Roadmap — Detailed Landscape (v3)

This file extends the prediction mapping and defines how the W-lattice
naturally generates **future particles**, both near to known fermions
and far across the mass spectrum.

The key principle:

> **Known particles = occupied nodes.**  
> **Unused valid nodes = new particles.**

No assumptions from SM needed — classification is informational-first.

## D1 — Primary Neighbour States (B-type)

These appear by taking the nearest valid N-slot (minimal ΔN).
They are **mandatory** in W-structure.

| State | Source | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **t′** | next above t | heavy top-doublet, Δm ~ MeV |
| **b′** | next above b | bottom-doublet, Δm extremely tiny |
| **L (τ′)** | next above tau | lepton neighbour, merged into τ |

Primary means "*exists informationally regardless of detection*".

## D2 — Mid-Zone Structured States (A-type)

Logarithmic midpoint between known masses.

| State | Region | Est. Projection |
|---|---|---|
| **X** | between c and b | ≈2.2 GeV |
| **Y1** | between b and t | ≈10–30 GeV |

These are **search candidates** for collider & spectrum experiments.

## D3 — Ladders & Generative Space

Once a pair exists, intermediate nodes can be enumerated:

- `c → X → b`
- `b → Y1 → t → t′ → …`
- `τ → L → L₂ → L₃ → …` (lepton ladder)
- mirrors on ultra-light side possible

The sequence forms discrete **spectral rails** in N-space.
