# Y1 — Mid-quark between b and t

Heavy mid-slot state between bottom and top quarks.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Region | between b and t |
| Slot type | Mid-state (A type) |
| Est. mass projection | **~10–30 GeV** |
| Discovery potential | collider search window |

Interpretation:

- From geometric midpoint: \(N_{Y1} ≈ √(N_b N_t)\)
- Heavier than b, lighter than t.
- **Key near-term experimental target.**
- Unlike t′ or b′, Y1 is not merged and may appear as a resonance.
