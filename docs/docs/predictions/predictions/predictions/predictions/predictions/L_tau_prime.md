# L (tau prime) — Lepton neighbour above τ

Primary informational neighbour of the tau lepton.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Region | above τ |
| Slot type | Primary neighbour |
| Δm | extremely small |
| Behaviour | merged with τ fundamentally |

Notes:

- Mandatory slot from nearest-ΔN rule.
- Exists as a **τ–L doublet**, analogous to b–b′ and t–t′.
- Projected mass split is small enough to be experimentally hidden.
