# X — Mid-quark between c and b

A geometric-mid state between charm and bottom in N-space.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Region | between c and b |
| Slot type | Mid-state (A type) |
| Estimate | ~2.2 GeV physical projection |
| Phenomenology | hadron spectroscopy candidate |

Interpretation:

- This is the **first mid-slot prediction** between heavy quarks.
- Appears from geometric midpoint: \(N_X ≈ √(N_c N_b)\)
- Could be detectable as a new narrow hadronic resonance.
