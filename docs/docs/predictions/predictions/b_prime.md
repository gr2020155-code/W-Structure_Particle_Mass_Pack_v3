# b′ — Bottom-neighbour informational state

Nearest valid lattice slot above the bottom quark.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| (p,q,s) | (1240000000, 1240000001, 1) |
| Slot type | Primary neighbour |
| Δm projection | extremely tiny relative to b |
| Phenomenology | merged within b peak |

Notes:

- Mandatory neighbour via minimal-ΔN rule.
- Predicted as a **b–b′ doublet**, similar to t–t′.
- Experimentally hidden inside natural bottom width.
